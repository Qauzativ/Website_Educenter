As pompous and cliche *giving you the power over your data* may sound, at least
one of our products truly does that. We operate an open source business model.
Before getting any payment for our products or services, we give something
valuable to the community.

**QZ Community**, a SQL Server powered datawarehouse with open source code,
builds a coherent datamart from credit / insurance bureau reports that have
piled up in your file storage systems over the years and enhances it with other
data from CRM or ERP that you deem necessary to utilize in DSML (data science
and machine learning) projects.

**QZ Cloud** takes things to another level by operating on a much broader scope
of data, taking advantage of the powerful tools that Microsoft's Azure has
to offer.

### Qauzativ Community -- an open source DSML datamart

QZ Community will be a valuable asset in the IT infrastructure **if your company:**

* Has developers and database engineers to administer the data locally
  and deploy QZ Community as an analytics & predictive modeling datamart

* Has data scientists to build the models and engineers to deploy them --->
  SQL Server that powers QZ Community is great for storing data
  and for running models in production directly on the data

* Is in lending, insurance or retail business ---> that's what the current
  edition of Qauzativ Community handles best. You are most welcome to contribute
  to the codebase on GitHub and share extra features with the community.

* Wants to put credit and insurance bureau reports to good use in DSML projects

### Qauzativ Cloud -- versatile, flexible enterprise DWH for ML

QZ Cloud caters to a broad range of use cases in large and small companies
alike, and could be the right choice **if your company:**

* Has multiple sources of data from applications -- ERP, CRM, accounting
  software, website, mobile apps, etc. -- and that data keeps getting bigger

* Doesn't want to lock itself into a rigid proprietary DWH solution that
  is costly to buy, maintain and upgrade
  
* Believes that a flexible and extensible datawarehouse is required to handle
  dynamic and growing dataflows of the modern age

* Views data science and machine learning as a support function rather than
  a primary line of business ---> hence ready to outsource the DSML function
  in some part

* Doesn't have a sufficiently large team of engineera and data scientists to handle
  all the datawarehousing, data analytics and predictive modeling in-house

### Training = Solutions

Our core DSML track is more of a product than a service: it follows an
industry-standard data scientist curriculum.
Other ML tracks have more custom-tailored content.

For the trainees's better learning experience, we guide them through multiple
practice-based projects as well as multiple online and offline courses.

For a better return on your investment, at least
one of those projects is turned into a real-life solution that you require.

**If your company:**

* Has 5+ employees to be trained into data analysts so that their business
  domain expertise becomes a valuable contribution to DSML projects
  
* Needs to upgrade the skillset of the team in a specific area of expertise,
  for example, computer vision, natural language processing or graph analysis

* Needs to develop and deploy into production some special solution(s)
  that your DSML team hasn't delivered yet

then one of our [**training programs**](/training) may be the right match
