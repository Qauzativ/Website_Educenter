> ##### _'In theory there is no difference between theory and practice. But in practice, there is.'_

***

For a company that invests in staff training, simply getting employees
to complete some online courses is not enough. Most courses do not teach
how to build end-to-end solutions.
That's not what most courses are created for.
The actual desired deliverable from employees' training is getting them
to build the ML solutions that your business needs.

***

### What our training programs are

Neither of our training programs is an online course of our own design.
They are comprehensive training programs led by data science practitioners.
To arm your team with the knowledge it needs to solve real-life data challenges,
the ML tracks are structured as follows:

* Guided workshops and seminars by ML practitioners, 2-3 times a week.
  Mostly offline and on-site, mixed with online technical mentoring and Q&A

* Online courses by [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com) give the basic
  skills, guide through a broad curriculum and provide a few minor projects.

* Optionally other online courses (edX, DataQuest) are added to the curriculum

* Textbooks. We provide the most popular books on the subject.
  Working through textbooks is essential for trainees' learning and future
  reference. No online course can substitute that.

* Lectures by university professors on advanced DSML topics such as deep neural
  networks and the supporting math

* Graduation projects (solutions) and interim practical projects

For the trainees's better learning experience, we guide them through multiple
practice-based projects as well as multiple online and offline courses.
For a better return on your investment, at least one of those projects
is turned into a real-life solution for your company.
Once that solutions is built, tested and ready for launch into production,
you have the option to deploy it in [QZ Cloud](/product/qauzativ_cloud).

Please see curriculum overview at the bottom of this page.

### Why we created the training programs?

Because they are an extension of our capabilities.
And for the following reasons below:

##### Democratize

We believe that DSML should be technically accessible to more people than
a few math-savvy data scientists.
Teaching the fundamentals of data science and machine learning to 10 or 20
employees from different business domains is simpler and faster than making
5 data scientists experts in 10 different business domains.
Given that data exploration and prototyping often takes 70-80% of entire project
time, contribution by domain experts will save senior data scientists a lot of
time and effort and bring substantial labour savings to the company.

##### Demystify and simplify

Practical DSML should be more about putting business domain expertise into
real-life models. No company wants its DSML investment to turn into a solution
looking for a problem to solve.

Practical DSML is also about re-using template solutions, rigorously testing,
carefully calibrating and interpreting the models.

We can not emphasize enough how efficient code re-use and boilerplate code
can be. It will eventually save hundreds of man-hours and thousands of US$
in labour costs once trainees start re-using standardized code templates that
come as part of the training.

##### Grow the team

Talent scarcity in DSML is a major issue that will not cease in the foreseeable
future, making in-house training a very reasonable option.

The bottom line of our ML training, especially the "Core DSML track", is getting
your employees trained in DSML so that they contribute their new skills
and existing business domain expertise along a few lines:

* Correct problem definition. *"A problem well defined is half-solved"*

* Data exploration and prototyping ---> labour cost savings and shorter time to production

* Project management, technical documentation, requirements management

### Curriculum comparison

While "Core DSML track" doesn't require prior background in computer science
or math, trainees taking "Deep ML track" and "Special ML track" are expected
to have intermediate knowledge of DSML fundamentals, linear algebra and Python
programming.

Note that a share of the "Core DSML track" codebase is freely available
on our [GitHub](https://www.github.com/Qauzativ) for your review.
